FlowSense-Traffic-Management-System

üìñ Overview

Welcome to FlowSense, an intelligent and adaptive traffic management system designed to revolutionize urban mobility. This project, meticulously crafted with Python and YOLOv8, introduces a smart solution that dynamically adapts to real-time traffic conditions. By harnessing the power of live CCTV feeds, FlowSense optimizes traffic flow by intelligently adjusting signal timings at intersections. The intuitive Admin GUI empowers users to effortlessly monitor and control traffic operations.

üåü Key Features

    Real-time Traffic Analysis: Employs YOLOv8 for precise vehicle detection and classification from live CCTV feeds.

    Adaptive Signal Timing: Dynamically recalibrates signal timings based on traffic density and vehicle types to minimize congestion and travel time.

    Admin GUI: A user-friendly interface to monitor live images, access comprehensive traffic statistics, and control traffic signals.

    Simulation Demo: A captivating simulation to visualize the dynamic traffic management system in action at a 2-way intersection.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

    Live Feed Analysis: YOLOv8 processes live feeds from CCTV cameras to detect and classify vehicles, gathering real-time traffic data.

    Signal Time Optimization: The system uses complex algorithms to calculate optimal signal timings based on the current traffic situation.

    Admin GUI: The graphical interface provides a centralized hub for users to view real-time data and influence traffic signals.
